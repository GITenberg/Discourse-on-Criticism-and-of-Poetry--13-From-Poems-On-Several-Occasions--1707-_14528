<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
What little is known of the life of Samuel Cobb (1675-1713) may be found
in the brief article in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> by W.P.
Courtney. He was born in London, and educated at Christ's Hospital and
at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained the degrees of B.A.,
1698, and M.A., 1702. He was appointed &quot;under grammar master&quot; at
Christ's Hospital in 1702 and continued his connection with this school
until his early death. He had a reputation for wit and learning, and
also for imbibing somewhat too freely. In his poetry he especially
cultivated the style of the free Pindaric ode, a predilection which won
him a mention without honor in Johnson's life of Pope (<i>Lives of the
Poets</i>, ed. Birkbeck Hill, III, 227). Even the heroic couplets of his
poem on &quot;Poetry&quot; aim rather at pseudo-Pindaric diffuseness than at
epigrammatic concentration of statement. As a critic Cobb deserves
attention in spite of his mediocrity, or even because of it. He helps to
fill out the picture of the literary London of his time, and his
opinions and tastes provide valuable side-lights on such greater men as
Dennis, Addison, and Pope. &quot;Of Poetry&quot; belongs to the prolific literary
type of &quot;progress poems,&quot; in which the modern student finds illuminating
statements as to how the eighteenth century surveyed and evaluated past
literary traditions. The list of Cobb's publications in the <i>Cambridge
Bibliography</i> suggests that he enjoyed some degree of popularity. His
volume, <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>, was published in 1707, and
reprinted in enlarged form in 1709 and 1710. The reproduction herewith
of the Preface &quot;On Criticism&quot; and the versified discourse &quot;Of Poetry&quot; is
from a copy of the 1707 edition in the Newberry Library, in Chicago.</p>

<h2>A DISCOURSE ON CRITICISM AND THE LIBERTY OF WRITING.</h2>


<h3>In a Letter to <i>Richard Carter</i> Esq; late of the <i>Middle-Temple</i>, now
living in <i>Barbadoes</i>.</h3>


<p>SIR,</p>

<p><i>The</i> Muses <i>are said to be the Daughters of Memory: A Poet therefore
must lay down his Title to their Favour, who can be forgetful of a
Friend, like You, whose polite Knowledge, instructive Conversation, and
particulur Generosity to my self, have left such strong Impressions upon
my Mind, as defy the Power of Absence to remove them. I scarce believe
Death it self can blot out an</i> Idea <i>so firmly imprinted. The Soul, when
it leaves this earthly Habitation, and has no more Use for those
Vertues, which were serviceable in the Conduct of human Life, such as</i>
Temperance, Fortitude <i>and the like, will certainly carry</i> Love <i>and</i>
Gratitude <i>along with it to Heaven. This may suffice to let the World
know what Obligations you have laid upon me.</i></p>

<p><i>By this Letter (the room of which, for your sake I could willingly have
supply'd) you will plainly see, that no Place, however remote, is able
to secure you from the Zeal of a</i> Friend, <i>and the Vanity of a</i> Poet.</p>


<p class="verse">For tho' retiring to the <i>Western Isles</i>,<br />
  At the long Distance of five thousand Miles,<br />
  You've chang'd <i>dear London</i> for your Native Seat,<br />
  And think <i>Barbadoes</i> is a safe Retreat;<br />
  You highly err: Nor is the <i>Wat'ry Fence</i><br />
  Sufficient Guard against Impertinence.<br />
  The <i>Muse</i>, which smiles on jingling Bards, like Me,<br />
  Has always Winds to waft her o'er the Sea.<br />
  Blow on, ye Winds, and o'er th' <i>Atlantick Main</i>,<br />
  Bear to my Gen'rous Friend this thankful Strain.</p>

<p><i>You see, Sir, I have not left off that rhyming Trick of Youth; but
knowing You to be a Gentleman who loves Variety in every thing, I
thought it would not be ungrateful if I checquer'd my Prose with a
little Verse.</i></p>

<p><i>After this Preamble, it is presum'd, that one who lives on the Other
side of the Globe, will expect by every Pacquet-boat to know what is
done on This. Since Your Departure, Affairs have had a surprizing Turn
every where, and particularly in</i> Italy; <i>which Success of our Armies
and Allies abroad, have given a manifest Proof of our wise Counsels at
home. &mdash;&mdash;Parties still run between</i> High <i>and</i> Low. <i>I shall make no
Remarks on either; thinking it always more prudent, as well as more
safe, to live peaceably under the Government in which I was born, rather
than peevishly to quarrel with it.</i></p>

<p><i>But You will cry,</i> Who expects any thing from the Politicks of a Poet?
How goes the State of <i>Parnassus</i>? What has the Battle of <i>Ramillies</i>
produc'd? <i>What Battles generally do; bad Poets, and worse Criticks. I
could not perswade my self to attempt any thing above six Lines, which
had not been made, were it not at the Request of a Musical Gentleman.
You will look upon them with the same Countenance you us'd to do on
things of a larger Size.</i></p>

<p class="verse">Born to surprize the World, and teach the Great<br />
  The slippery Danger of exalted State,<br />
  Victorious <i>Marlbr&ocirc;</i> to <i>Ramilly</i> flies;<br />
  Arm'd with new Lightning from bright <i>ANNA's</i> Eyes.<br />
  Wonders like These, no former Age has seen;<br />
  Subjects are <i>Heroes</i>, where a Saint's the <i>QUEEN</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> Congreve <i>has given the World an Ode, and prefix'd to it a
Discourse on the</i> Pindaric Verse, <i>of which more, when I come to speak
on the same Argument: There are several others on that Subject, and some
which will bear the Test; one particularly, written in imitation of the
Style of</i> Spencer; <i>and goes under the Name of Mr.</i> Prior; <i>I have not
read it through, but</i> ex pede Herculem. <i>He is a Gentleman who cannot
write ill. Yet some of our</i> Criticks <i>have fell upon it, as the Viper
did on the File, to the detriment of their Teeth. So that Criticism,
which was formerly the Art of judging well, is now become the pure
Effect of Spleen, Passion and Self-conceit. Nothing is perfect in every
Part. He that expects to see any thing so, must have patience till</i>
Dooms-day. <i>The Worship we pay to our own Opinion, generally leads its
to the Contempt of another's. This blind Idolatry of</i> Self <i>is the
Mother of Errour; and this begets a secret Vanity in our</i> Modern
Censurers, <i>who, when they please to</i> think a Meaning <i>for an Author,
would thereby insinuate how much his Judgment is inferiour to their
inlighten'd Sagacity. When, perhaps, the Failings they expose are a
plain Evidence of their own Blindness.</i></p>

<p class="verse">For to display our Candour and our Sence,<br />
  Is to discover some deep <i>Excellence</i>.<br />
  The Critick's faulty, while the Poet's free;<br />
  They raise the <i>Mole hill, who want Eyes to see</i>.</p>

<p><i>Excrescences are easily perceiv'd by an ordinary Eye; but it requires
the Penetration of a</i> Lynceus <i>to discern the Depth of a good Poem; the
secret Artfulness and Contrivance of it being conceal'd from a Vulgar
Apprehension.</i></p>

<p><i>I remember somewhere an Observation of St.</i> Evremont <i>(an Author whom
you us'd to praise, and whom therefore I admire) that some Persons, who
would be Poets, which they cannot be, become Criticks which they can be.
The censorious Grin, and the loud Laugh, are common and easy things,
according to</i> Juvenal; <i> and according to</i> Scripture, <i>the Marks of a</i>
Fool. <i>These Men are certainly in a deplorable Condition, who cannot be
witty, but at another's Expence, and who take an unnatural kind of
Pleasure in being uneasy at their Own.</i></p>

<p class="verse">Rules they can write, but, like the <i>College Tribe</i>,<br />
  Take not that Physick which their Rules prescribe.<br />
  I scorn to praise a plodding, formal Fool,<br />
  <i>Insipidly</i> correct, and <i>dull</i> by Rule:<br />
  <i>Homer</i>, with all his <i>Nodding</i>, I would chuse,<br />
  Before the more exact <i>Sicilian</i> Muse.<br />
  Who'd not be <i>Dryden</i>; tho' his Faults are great,<br />
  Sooner than our Laborious <i>Laureat</i>?<br />
  Not but a decent Neatness, I confess,<br />
  In <i>Writing</i> is requir'd, as well as <i>Dress</i>.<br />
  Yet still in both the <i>unaffected Air</i><br />
  Will always please the <i>Witty</i> and the <i>Fair</i>.</p>

<p><i>I would not here be thought to be a Patron of slovenly Negligence; for
there is nothing which breeds a greater Aversion in Men of a</i> Delicate
Taste. <i>Yet you know, Sir, that, after all our Care and Caution, the
Weakness of our Nature will eternally mix it self in every thing we
write; and an over curious Study of being correct, enervates the Vigour
of the Mind, slackens the Spirits, and cramps the Genius of a</i> Free
Writer. <i>He who creeps by the Shore, may shelter himself from a Storm,
but likely to make very few Discoveries: And the cautious Writer, who is
timorous of disobliging the captious Reader, may produce you true
Grammar, and unexceptionable</i> Prosodia, <i>but most stupid Poetry.</i></p>

<p class="verse">In vitium culp&aelig; ducit fuga, si caret arte.</p>

<p><i>A slavish Fear of committing an Oversight, betrays a Man to more
inextricable Errours, than the Boldness of an enterprizing Author, whose
artful Carelesness is more instructive and delightful than all the Pains
and Sweat of the Poring and Bookish Critick.</i></p>

<p><i>Some Failings, like Moles in a beautiful Countenance, take nothing from
the Charms of a happy Composure, but rather heighten and improve their
Value. Were our modern Reflecters Masters of more Humanity than
Learning, and of more Discernment than both, the Authors of the Past and
Present Ages, would have no reason to complain of Injustice; nor would
that Reflection be cast upon the</i> best-natur'd Nation <i>in the World,
that, when rude and ignorant, we were unhospitable to Strangers, and
now, being civiliz'd, we expend our Barbarity on one another</i>. Homer
<i>would not be so much the Ridicule of our</i> Beaux Esprits; <i>when, with
all his Sleepiness, he is propos'd as the most exquisite Pattern of
Heroic Writing, by the Greatest of Philosophers, and the Best of Judges.
Nor is</i> Longinus <i>behind hand with</i> Aristotle <i>in his Character of the
same Author, when he tells us that the Greatness of</i> Homer's <i>Soul
look'd above little Trifles (which are Faults in meaner Capacities) and
hurry'd on to his Subject with a Freedom of Spirit peculiar to himself.
A Racer at</i> New-market <i>or the</i> Downs, <i>which has been fed and drest,
and with the nicest Caution prepared for the Course, will stumble
perhaps at a little Hillock; while the Wings of</i> Pegasus <i>bear him o'er
Hills and Mountains,</i></p>

<p class="verse">Sub pedibusq; videt nubes &amp; sydera&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Such was the Soul of</i> Homer: <i>who is more justly admir'd by those who
understand him, than he is derided by the Ignorant: Whose Writings
partake as much of that Spirit, as he attributes to the Actions of his</i>
Heroes; <i>and whose Blindness is more truly chargeable on his</i> Criticks,
<i>than on</i> Himself: <i>who, as he wrote without a Rule, was himself a Rule
to succeeding Ages. Who as much deserves that Commendation which</i>
Alcibiades <i>gave to</i> Socrates, <i>when he compar'd him to the Statues of
the</i> Sileni, <i>which to look upon, had nothing beautiful and ornamental;
but open them, and there you might discover the Images of all the Gods
and Goddesses.</i></p>

<p><i>Who knows the secret Springs of the Soul, and those sudden Emotions,
which excite illustrious Men, to act and speak out of the</i> Common Road?
<i>They seem irregular to Us by reason of the Fondness and Bigottry we pay
to</i> Custom, <i>which is no Standard to the Brave and the Wise. The Rules
we receive in our first Education, are laid down with this Purpose, to
restrain the</i> Mind; <i>which by reason of the Tenderness of our Age and
the ungovernable Disposition of Young Nature, is apt to start out into
Excess and Extravagance. But when Time has ripen'd us, and Observation
has fortify'd the Soul, we ought to lay aside those common Rules with
our Leading strings; and exercise our Reason with a free, generous and
manly Spirit. Thus a</i> Good Poet <i>should make use of a Discretionary
Command; like a</i> Good General, <i>who may rightly wave the vulgar Precepts
of the Military School (which may confine an ordinary Capacity, and curb
the Rash and Daring) if by a new and surprizing Method of Conduct, he
find out an uncommon Way to Glory and Success.</i></p>

<p>Bocalin, <i>the</i> Italian <i>Wit, among his other odd Advertisements, has
this remarkable one, which is parallel to the present Discourse. When</i>
Tasso <i>(says he) had presented</i> Apollo <i>with his</i> Poem, <i>call'd</i>
Giurasalemme Liberata; <i>the</i> Reformer <i>of the</i> Delphic Library, <i>to
whose Perusal it was committed, found fault with it, because it was not
written according to the Rules of</i> Aristotle; <i>which affront being
complain'd of,</i> Apollo <i>was highly incens'd, and chid</i> Aristotle <i>for
his Presumption in daring to prescribe Laws and Rules to the high
Conceptions of the</i> Virtuosi, <i>whose Liberty of Writing and Inventing,
enrich'd the Schools and Libraries with gallant Composures; and to
enslave the Wits of Learned Men, was to rob the World of those alluring
Charms which daily flow'd from the Productions of Poets, who follow the
Dint of their own unbounded Imagination. You will find the rest in the
28th Advertisement.</i></p>

<p><i>The Moral is instructive; because to judge well and candidly, we must
wean our selves from a slavish Bigotry to the Ancients. For, tho'</i> Homer
<i>and</i> Virgil, Pindar <i>and</i> Horace <i>be laid before us as Examples of
exquisite Writing in the Heroic and Lyric Kind, yet, either thro' the
Distance of Time, or Diversity of Customs, we can no more expect to find
like Capacities, than like Complexions. Let a Man follow the Talent that
Nature has furnish'd him with, and his own Observation has improv'd, we
may hope to see Inventions in all Arts, which may dispute Superiority
with the best of the</i> Athenian <i>and</i> Roman <i>Excellencies</i>.</p>

<p class="verse">Nec minimum meru&ecirc;re decus vestigia Gr&aelig;ca
  Ausi deserere.&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>It is another Rule of the same Gentleman, that we should attempt
nothing beyond our Strength: There are some modern</i> Milo's <i>who have
been wedg'd in that Timber which they strove to rend. Some have fail'd
in the Lyric Way who have been excellent in the Dramatic. And, Sir,
would you not think a Physician would gain more Profit and Reputation
by</i> Hippocrates <i>and</i> Galen <i>well-studied, than by</i> Homer <i>and</i> Virgil
<i>ill-copied?</i></p>

<p>Horace, <i>who was as great a Master of Judgment, as he was an Instance of
Wit, would have laid the Errours of an establish'd Writer on a
pardonable Want of Care, or excus'd them by the Infirmity of Human
Nature; he would have wondred at the corrupt Palates now a-days, who
quarrel with their Meat, when the Fault is in their Taste. To reform
which, if our Moderns would lay aside the malicious Grin and drolling
Sneer, the Passions and Prejudices to Persons and Circumstances, we
should have better Poems, and juster Criticisms. Nothing casts a greater
Cloud on the Judgment than the Inclination (or rather Resolution) to
praise or condemn, before we see the Object. The Rich and the Great lay
a Trap for Fame, and have always a numerous Crowd of servile Dependants,
to clap their Play, or admire their Poem.</i></p>

<p class="verse">    For noble Scriblers are with Flattery fed,<br />
  And none dare tell their Fault who eat their Bread.</p>

<p class="verse">                                   <i>Dryden's Pers..</i></p>

<p>Juvenal <i>shews his Aversion to this Prepossession, when his old
disgusted Friend gives this among the rest of his Reasons why he left
the Town,</i></p>

<p class="verse">                 &mdash;Mentiri nescio: librum<br />
  Si malus est, nequeo laudare &amp; poscere.</p>

<p><i>To conquer Prejudice is the part of a Philosopher; and to discern a
Beauty is an Argument of good Sense and Sagacity; and to find a Fault
with Allowances for human Frailty, is the Property of a Gentleman.</i></p>

<p><i>Who then is this Critick? You will find him in</i> Quintilius Varus, <i>of</i>
Cremona, <i>who when any Author shew'd him his Composure, laid aside the</i>
Fastus <i>common to our supercilious Readers; and when he happen'd on any
Mistake</i>, Corrige sodes Hoc aiebat &amp; hoc.</p>

<p><i>Such is the Critick I would find, and such would I prove my self to
others. I am sorry I must go into my Enemies Country to find out another
like him. Our</i> English <i>Criticks having taken away a great deal from the
Value of their Judgment, by dashing it with some splenetick Reflections.
Like a certain Nobleman mention'd by my Lord</i> Verulam, <i>who when he
invited any Friends to Dinner, always gave a disrelish to the
Entertaiment by some cutting malicious Jest.</i></p>

<p><i>The</i> French <i>then seem to me to have a truer Taste of the ancient
Authors than ever</i> Scaliger <i>or</i> Heinsius <i>could pretend to</i>. Rapin,
<i>and above all</i>, Bossu, <i>have done more Justice to</i> Homer <i>and to</i>
Virgil, <i>to</i> Livy <i>and</i> Thucydides, <i>to</i> Demosthenes <i>and to</i> Cicero,
<i>&amp;c. and have bin more beneficial to the Republick of Learning, by their
nice Comparisons and Observations, than all the honest Labours of those
well-meaning Men, who rummage</i> musty Manuscripts <i>for</i> various Lections.
<i>They did not</i> Insistere in ipso cortice, verbisq; interpretandis
intenti nihil ultra petere, (<i>As</i> Dacier <i>has it</i>) <i>but search'd the
inmost Recesses, open'd their Mysteries, and (as it were) call'd the
Spirit of the Author from the Dead. It is for this</i> Le Clerc <i>(in his</i>
Bibliotheque Choisie, <i>Tom.</i> 9. <i>p.</i> 328.) <i>commends St.</i> Evremont's
<i>Discourses on</i> Salust <i>and</i> Tacitus, <i>as also his Judgment on the
Ancients, and blames the Grammarians, because they give us not a Taste
of Antiquity after his Method, which would invite our Polite Gentlemen
to study it with a greater Appetite. Whereas their Manner of Writing,
which takes Notice only of Words, Customs, and chiefly Chronology, with
a blind Admiration of all they read, is unpleasant to a fine Genius, and
deters it from the pursuit of the</i> Belles Lettres.</p>

<p><i>I shall say no more at present on this Head, but proceed to give you an
Account of the following Sheets. What I have attempted in them is mostly
of the Pindaric and the Lyric Way. I have not follow'd the</i> Strophe
<i>and</i> Antistrophe; <i>neither do I think it necessary; besides I had
rather err with Mr.</i> Cowley, <i>who shew'd us the Way, than be flat and in
the right with others.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr.</i> Congreve, <i>an ingenious Gentleman, has affirm'd, I think too
hastily, that in each particular Ode the Stanza's are alike, whereas the
last Olympic has two</i> Monostrophicks <i>of different Measure, and Number
of Lines.</i></p>

<p><i>The Pacquet-boat is just going off, I am afraid of missing Tide. You
may expect the rest on the</i> Pindaric Style. <i>In the mean time I beg
leave to subscribe myself,</i></p>

  Like <i>Spencer's</i> Giant sunk away in Wind.<br />
  It grates judicious Readers when they meet<br />
  Nothing but jingling Verse, and even Feet.<br />
  Such false, such counterfeited Wings as these,<br />
  Forsake th' unguided Boy, and plunge him in the Seas.<span class="sidenote"><i>Dryden.</i></span><br />
  <i>Lee</i> aim'd to rise above great <i>Dryden's</i> Height,<br />
  But lofty <i>Dryden</i> keeps a steddy Flight.<br />
  Like D&aelig;dalus, he times with prudent Care<br />
  His well-wax'd Wings, and Waves in Middle Air.<br />
  The Native Spark, which first advanc'd his Name,<br />
  By industry he kindled to a Flame.<br />
  The proper Phrase of our exalted Tongue<br />
  To such Perfection from his Numbers sprung.<br />
  His Tropes continu'd, and his Figures fine,<br />
  <i>All of a Piece throughout, and all Divine.</i><br />
  His <i>Images</i> so strong and lively be,<br />
  I hear not Words alone, but Substance see;<br />
  Adapted Speech, and just Expressions move<br />
  Our various Passions, Pity, Rage and Love.<br />
  I weep to hear fond <i>Anthony</i> complain<br />

  But Comedy, 'tis Thought, can never claim<br />
  The sounding Title of a Poem's Name.<br />
  For Raillery, and what creates a Smile<br />
  Betrays no lofty Genius, nor a Style.<br />
  That <i>Heav'nly Heat</i> refuses to be seen<br />
  In a Town-Character and Comick Mien.</p>

<p class="verse">    If we would do him right, we must produce<br />
  The <i>Sophoclean Buskin</i>; when his Muse<br />
  With her loud Accents fills the list'ning Ear,<br />
  And <i>Peals</i> applauding shake the Theater.</p>

<p class="verse">    They fondly seek, Great Name, to blast thy Praise,<br />
  Who think that Foreign Thanks produc'd thy Bays.<br />
  Is he oblig'd to <i>France</i>, who draws from thence<br />
  By <i>English</i> Energy, their Captive Sense?<br />
  Tho' <i>Edward</i> and fam'd <i>Henry</i> Warr'd in vain,<br />
  Subduing what they could not long retain:<br />
  Yet now beyond our Arms the Muse prevails,<br />
  And Poets Conquer where the Hero fails.</p>

<p class="verse">  This does superiour excellence betray;<br />
  O could I Write in thy Immortal Way!<br />
  If Art be Nature's Scholar, and can make<br />
  Such vast improvements, Nature must forsake<br />
  Her Ancient Style; and in some grand Design<br />
  She must her Own Originals decline,<br />
  And for the Noblest Copies follow Thine.<br />
  Pardon this just transition to thy Praise,<br />
  Which Young <i>Thalia</i> sung in Rural Lays.</p>

<p class="verse">    As Sleep to weary Drovers on the Plain<br />
  As a sweet River to a thirsty Swain,<br />
  Such <i>Tityrus's</i> charming Number show,<br />
  Please like the River, like the River flow.<br />
  When his first Years in mighty Order ran,<br />
  And cradled Infancy bespoke the Man,<br />
  Around his Lips the <i>Waxen Artists</i> hung,<br />
  And drop'd ambrosial Dew upon his Tongue.<br />
  Then from his Mouth harmonious Numbers broke,<br />
  More sweet than Honey from a hollow Oke.<br />
  Pleasant as streams which from a Mountain Glide,<br />
  Yet lofty as the Top from whence they slide.</p>

<p class="verse">    Long He possest th' Hereditary Plains,<br />
  Admir'd by all the Herdsmen and the Swains.<br />
  Till he resign'd his Flock, opprest with cares,<br />
  Weaken'd by num'rous Woes, and grey with Years.<br />
  Yet still, like <i>&AElig;tna's</i> <i>Mount</i>, he kept his Fire,<br />
  And look'd like beauteous Roses on a Brier.<br />
  He smil'd, like <i>Phoebus</i> in a Stormy Morn,<br />
  And sung, like <i>Philomel</i> against a Thorn.</p>

<p class="verse">    Here <i>Syren of sweet Poesy</i>, receive<br />
  That little praise my unknown Muse can give.<br />
  Thou shalt immortal be, no Censure fear<br />
  Tho' angry <i>B&mdash;&mdash; more</i> in Heroicks jeer.</p>

<p class="verse">    A Bard, who seems to challenge <i>Virgil's</i> Flame,<br />
  And would be next in Majesty and Name.<br />
  With lofty <i>Maro</i> he at first may please;<br />
  The Righteous <i>Briton</i> rises by degrees.<br />
  But once on Wing, thro' secret Paths he rows,<br />
  And leaves his Guide, or follows him too close,<br />
  The <i>Mantuan</i> Swan keeps a soft gentle Flight,<br />
  Is always Tow'ring, but still Plays in Sight.<br />
  Calm and Serene his Verse; his active Song<br />
  Runs smooth as <i>Thames's</i> River, and as strong.<br />
  Like his own <i>Neptune</i> he the Waves confines,<br />
  While <i>Bl&mdash;&mdash; re</i> rumbles, like the King of Winds.<br />
  His flat Descriptions, void of Manly Strength,<br />
  Jade out our Patience with excessive length.<br />
  While Readers, Yawning o'er his <i>Arthurs</i> see<br />
  Whole Pages spun on one poor <i>Simile</i>.<br />
  We grant he labours with no want of Brains,<br />
  Or Fire, or Spirit; but He spares the Pains,<br />
  One happy Thought, or two, may at a Heat<br />
  Be struck, but Time and Study must compleat<br />
  A Verse, sublimely Good, and justly Great.<br />
  It call'd for an Omnipotence to raise<br />
  The <i>World's</i> <i>Imperial Poem</i> in Six Days.<br />
  But Man, that offspring of corrupting Clay,<br />
  Subject to Err, and Subject to Decay:<br />
  In Hopes, Desires, Will, Power, a numerous Train,<br />
  Uncertain, Fickle, Impotent and Vain:<br />
  Must tire the Heav'nly Muse with endless Prayer,<br />
  And call the smiling Angels to his care.<br />
  Must sleep less Nights, <i>Vulcanian</i> Labours prove,<br />
  Like <i>Cyclops</i>, forging Thunder for a <i>Jove</i>.<br />
  With Flame begin thy Glorious Thoughts and Style,<br />
  Then Cool, and bring them to the smoothing File.<br />
  If You design to make Your Prince appear<br />
  As perfect as Humanity can bear.<br />
  Whom Vertues at th' expence of Danger please,<br />
  Deaf to the <i>Syrens</i> of alluring ease.<br />
  No Terrours Thee, <i>Achilles</i>, could invade,<br />
  Nor Thee, <i>Ulysses</i>, any Charms persuade.<br />
  This must be done, if Poets would be Read,<br />
  Who seek to emulate the Sacred Dead.</p>

<p class="verse">    Thus in bright Numbers and well polish'd Strains<br />
  <i>Virgilian Addison</i> describes <i>Campaigns</i>.<br />
  Whose Verse, like a proportion'd Man, we find,<br />
  Not of the <i>Gyant</i>, nor the <i>Pygmy</i> kind.<br />
  Such Symmetry appears o'er all the Song,<br />
  Lofty with justness, and with Caution strong.</p>

<p class="verse">    This <i>Congreve</i> follows in his Deathless Line,<br />
  And the <i>Tenth Hand</i> is put to the Design.<br />
  The Happy boldness of his Finish'd Toil<br />
  Claims more than <i>Shakespear's</i> Wit, or <i>Johnson's</i> Oil.<br />
  Sing on, <i>Harmonious Swan</i>, in weeping strains,<br />
  And tell <i>Pastora's</i> Death to mournful Swains.<br />
  Or with more pleasing Charms, with softer Airs<br />
  Sweeten our Passions, and delude our Cares.<br />
  Or let thy <i>Satyr</i> grin with half a Smile,<br />
  And jeer in <i>Easy Etherege's</i> Style.<br />
  Let <i>Manly Wycherly</i> chalk out the Way,<br />
  And Art direct, where Nature goes astray.<br />
  'Tis not for Thee to Write of Conqu'ring Kings,<br />
  The Noise of Arms will break thy Am'rous Strings.</p>

<p class="verse">    The <i>Teian Muse</i> invites Thee from above<br />
  To lay Thy Trumpet down, and sing of Love.<br />
  Let <i>MONTAGUE</i> describe <i>Boyn's</i> swelling Flood<br />
  And purple Streams fatned with Hostile Blood.<br />
  O Heavenly Patron of the needy Muse!<br />
  Whose powerful Name can nobler heat infuse.<br />
  When You <i>Nassau's</i> bright Actions dar'd to see,<br />
  <i>You</i> was the <i>Eagle</i>, and <i>Apollo He</i>.<br />
  But when He read You, and Your Value knew,<br />
  <i>He</i> was the <i>Eagle</i>, and <i>Apollo You</i>.<br />
  Both spoke the Bird in her <i>&AElig;thereal</i> height,<br />
  The <i>Majesty</i> was <i>His</i>, and <i>Thine</i> the <i>Flight</i>.<br />
  Both did <i>Apollo</i> in His Glory shew,<br />
  The Silver <i>Harp</i> was <i>Thine</i>, and <i>His</i> the <i>Bow</i>,</p>

<p class="verse">    So may <i>Pierian Clio</i> cease to fear,<br />
  When <i>Honour</i> deigns to sing, and <i>Majesty</i> to hear!<br />
  So may she favour'd live, and always please<br />
  Our <i>Dorset's</i>, and Judicious <i>Normanby's</i>!</p>

<p class="verse">    Nor does the <i>Coronet</i> alone defend<br />
  The Muses Cause: The <i>Miter</i> is Her Friend.<br />
  Can we forget how <i>Damon's</i> lofty Tongue<br />
  Shook the glad Mountains? how the Valleys rung<br />
  When <i>Rochester's Seraphick Shepherd</i> Sung.<br />
  How <i>Mars</i> and <i>Pallas</i> wept to see the Day<br />
  When <i>Athens</i> by a Plague dispeopled lay.<br />
  What Learning perish'd, and what Lives it cost!<br />
  Sung with more Spirit than all <i>Athens</i> lost.<br />
  Nor can the <i>Miter</i> now conceal the Bays,<br />
  For still we view the <i>Sacred Poet's</i> praise.<br />
  So tho' <i>Eridanus</i> becomes a Star<br />
  Exalted to the Skies, and shines afar,<br />
  Below he loses nothing but his Name,<br />
  Still faithful to his Banks, his Stream's the same.</p>

<p class="verse">    But smile, my Muse, once more upon my Song,<br />
  Let <i>Creech</i> be numbred with the Sacred Throng.<br />
  Whose daring Muse could with <i>Manilius</i> fly,<br />
  And, like an <i>Atlas</i>, shoulder up the Sky.<br />
  He's mounted, where no vulgar Eye can trace<br />
  His Wondrous footsteps and mysterious race.<br />
  See, how He walks above in mighty strains,<br />
  And wanders o'er the wide Ethereal Plains!<br />
  He sings what Harmony the Spheres obey,<br />
  In Verse more tuneful, and more sweet than they.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
